The sun rises in the east. The sky is painted with hues of pink and orange.
Birds chirp in the morning. Trees sway gently in the breeze.
The ocean waves crash on the shore. The moonlight reflects on the water.
Flowers bloom in spring. Children play and laugh with joy.
People enjoy picnics in the park. The air smells fresh and clean after the rain.
