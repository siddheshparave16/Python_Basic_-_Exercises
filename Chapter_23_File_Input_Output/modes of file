Detailed Explanation of Each Mode:
1. r (Read Only):
Used to read files.
The file must exist; otherwise, it raises a FileNotFoundError.
The file's contents cannot be modified.


2. r+ (Read and Write):
Allows both reading and writing.
The file must exist; otherwise, it raises a FileNotFoundError.
Writing begins at the start of the file (overwrites content unless handled carefully).


3. w (Write Only):
Used for writing.
If the file already exists, its contents are truncated (erased).
If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
Reading is not allowed.


4. w+ (Write and Read):
Allows both writing and reading.
If the file exists, its contents are truncated (erased).
If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
Writing starts at the start of the file.


5. a (Append Only):
Used for appending to a file.
If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
Writing occurs at the end of the file, without truncating the existing content.
Reading is not allowed.


6. a+ (Append and Read):
Allows both appending and reading.
If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
Writing occurs at the end of the file.
Reading occurs from the start of the file, but writing always appends to the end.



# The seek() function sets the position of a file pointer and
  the tell() function returns the current position of a file pointer.


# Serialization and Deserialization notes

For your example,
json.dump() writes directly to the file, and json.load() reads from it.
If you wanted to use a string for serialization instead of a file, you'd use json.dumps() and json.loads()
